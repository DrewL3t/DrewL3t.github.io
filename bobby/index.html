<h2>Here are some nice quotes from my show that'll make you feel good on the inside</h2>

<p>"There's nothing wrong with having a tree as a friend."</p>
<p>"The secret to doing anything is believing that you can do it. Anything that you believe you can do strong enough, you can do. Anything. As long as you believe."</p>
<p>"We don't make mistakes. We just have happy accidents."</p>
<p>"I think there's an artist hidden at the bottom of every single one of us."</p>
<p>"You too can paint almighty pictures."</p>
<p>"No pressure. Just relax and watch it happen."</p>
<p>"Don’t forget to make all these little things individuals -- all of them special in their own way."</p>
<p>"It’s so important to do something every day that will make you happy."</p>
